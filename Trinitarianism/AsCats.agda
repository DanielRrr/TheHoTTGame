{-
  Here are some things that we could like to have in a category
  (in which we want to do maths e.g. the category of sets)
  * Initial objects (empty set)
  * Terminal objects (singleton)
  * Sums
  * Products
  * Cartesian closed (for two objects A B, maps A → B
    are also an object in the category)
  * Natural numbers object (the natural numbers ℕ in Set)
  * and maybe more
