The HoTT Game
*************

The Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) Game is a project written by mathematicians
for mathematicians interested in HoTT and no experience in proof verification,
with the aim of introducing
`cubical agda <https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0/language/cubical.html>`_
as a tool for trying out mathematics in HoTT.
This page will help you get the Game working for you.

For instructions on how to get started with the HoTT Game,
